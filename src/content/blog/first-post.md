## Echoes on the Water, V in the Sky

Echoes on the Water, V in the Sky

### Echoes on the Water V in the Sky

Geese are remarkable birds known for their distinctive V-formation during migration. As waterfowl, they are perfectly at home both in the sky and on the water. Their loud, honking calls are a familiar sound in many parts of the world, echoing across lakes and fields. These birds belong to the Anatidae family, which also includes swans and ducks. They possess strong wings and webbed feet, making them powerful swimmers and flyers.
