    <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and building products that
      are not only functional but also delightful to use. For me, development is
      a craft that blends logical problem-solving with a touch of artistry.
    </p>

    <h2>The Journey</h2>
    <p>
      My path into software development started with a simple "Hello, World!"
      but quickly grew into a deep passion. From tinkering with personal scripts
      to building full-stack applications, every project has been a stepping
      stone. This website itself is part of that journey—a place to document and
      share what I learn along the way.
    </p>

    <h2>Skills & Tools</h2>
    <p>Here are some of the technologies I enjoy working with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Languages:</strong> TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust, Python
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Frameworks:</strong> Astro, SvelteKit, React, Next.js
      </li>
      <li>
