🐛 fix(ui): Resolve theme and font-size flickering (FOUC)

This commit resolves the Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) for the theme and font-size on both initial page loads and client-side navigation with View Transitions. It also includes several feature and style enhancements.

### Key Changes:

- **FOUC Prevention (`🐛 fix`):**
  - Added a blocking inline script to `<head>` to apply theme and font-size from `localStorage` before the initial render.
  - Utilized the `astro:after-swap` event to re-apply styles immediately during View Transitions, ensuring consistency across pages.
  - Refactored `theme-controller.ts` to remove redundant initialization logic, simplifying its role to handle user interactions.

- **About Page (`✨ feat`):**
  - Added new "Mission" and "Vision" sections to the `about.astro` page to better convey the developer's philosophy.

- **Component Styling (`🎨 style`):**
  - Increased the `border-radius` on `ProjectCard` and `BlogPostPreview` components from `rounded-lg` to `rounded-2xl` for a softer, more modern aesthetic.

- **Internationalization (`🌐 refactor`):**
  - Improved CSS `word-break` handling by applying `word-break: keep-all` only to Korean content (`:lang(ko)`), ensuring correct line breaks for both English and Korean text.
