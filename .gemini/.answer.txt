âœ¨ feat: Migrate image handling to Astro's built-in Assets API

Removed the deprecated `@astrojs/image` package and its configuration from `astro.config.mjs`.
Verified existing image usage in `ProjectCard.astro` already utilizes `astro:assets`.
This resolves the `virtual:image-loader` error and aligns with Astro v5+ best practices for image optimization.
