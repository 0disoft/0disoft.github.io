:sparkles: Feat: Implement image optimization

- Install `@astrojs/image` and `sharp` for image processing.
- Configure `@astrojs/image` integration in `astro.config.mjs`.
- Set `sharp` as the image service in Astro config.
- Update `ProjectCard.astro` to use Astro's `Image` component for optimized image loading.
- Fix: Correct `image` import in `astro.config.mjs` from named to default export.
- Address `virtual:image-loader` error by ensuring `sharp` is installed and configured.
- Note: Deprecation warning for `entryPoint` is acknowledged and will be resolved with future package updates.
